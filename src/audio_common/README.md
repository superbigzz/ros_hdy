On ROS Kinetic, the `master` branch is recommended.

# Development, Branch and Release Policy

This package is not under active development, but is accepting pull requests for bug fixes and new features. (Development may be done for serious bug fixes; pending maintainer time).

The `sound_play`, `groovy-devel` and `hydro-devel` branches are from previous ROS releases and are frozen; no new pull requests will be accepted on these branches.

The `indigo-devel` branch is the stable branch; only bug fixes are accepted on this branch. Periodic releases are done from `indigo-devel` into ROS Indigo and ROS Jade, with version numbers in the 0.2.x range.

The `master` branch is currently considered the development branch, and is released into ROS Kinetic with version numbers in the 0.3.x range. `master` is accepting new, non-breaking features and bug fixes.

Large, breaking changes such as changes to dependencies or the package API will be considered, but they will probably be staged into a development branch for release into the next major release of ROS (ROS L)
